## Core Idea

The simple rotating arm consists of a single beam attached to a motor or servo at a fixed pivot point. Vertical movement
results from the circular arc described by the beam's rotation.

## Advantages

* **Simplicity:** Easy and quick to build, requiring minimal materials and mechanical complexity.
* **Wide Motion Range:** Can achieve near-360-degree rotation if appropriately mounted, offering significant coverage in
  multiple directions.
* **Versatile Applications:** Ideal for simple tasks that don't require precise orientation, such as activating switches
  or scooping lightweight items.

## Disadvantages

* **Variable Lifting Force:** The force applied at the arm's end varies significantly throughout its rotational range
  due to gravity acting at different angles.
* **Lack of Orientation Control:** Unable to maintain a consistent orientation at the end effector, limiting its
  suitability for precise placement tasks.
* **Limited Payload:** Best suited for lightweight items due to the uneven torque and limited power at certain
  positions.

## Optimal Usage Scenarios

* Flicking switches, knocking objects over, or scooping lightweight items like poms.
* Tasks that do not require consistent end-effector orientation or precise control over object positioning.

## Quick Build Notes

* **High Pivot Mounting:** Mount the pivot point as high as permitted by KIPR rules to maximize the functional vertical
  range.
* **Rubber-Band Assistance:** Add rubber bands or elastic bands strategically to create a counterbalance effect,
  significantly reducing the servo load and prolonging motor life.
* **Balance:** Adjust the arm length and rubber-band tension to achieve optimal balance between speed and torque.

## Enhancements and Variations

* **Adjustable Length:** Implement telescopic or modular beams to easily adjust the arm's reach or leverage.
* **Counterweights:** Incorporate lightweight counterweights opposite the payload to balance heavier loads without
  straining the servo.
* **Multiple Arms:** Employ multiple rotating arms in parallel or sequence for coordinated tasks or increased functional
  versatility.

## Botball Applications

Frequently utilized for simple tasks like scooping poms during competitions, as seen during Botballâ€™s 2022 regional
tournaments. Proven effective for tasks where precision orientation is unnecessary, such as manipulating noodles and
other lightweight objects.
