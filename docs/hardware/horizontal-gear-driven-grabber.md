## Core Concept

The Horizontal Gear-Driven Grabber is a robust grabbing mechanism featuring two opposing jaws, driven synchronously by a single servo motor through a compact gear train. This ensures a symmetrical and controlled grip, essential for precise tasks such as capturing Botguy securely.

## Ideal Use Cases

* **Secure Side-Clamping:** Specifically designed for side-gripping tasks, particularly excelling at grasping Botguy by its neck.
* **Durability Under Pressure:** Highly robust under conditions involving significant shoving or external disturbances, maintaining a secure grip consistently.
* **Efficiency:** Offers reliability and simplicity, making it a favored choice for beginners and experienced Botball teams alike.

## Limitations

* **Pom Handling:** Ineffective for picking up soft, round objects such as poms, due to the rigid jaw configuration causing poms to slip rather than being securely gripped.

## Technical Specifications

* **Dimensions:** Approximately 4.5 inches by 3.1 inches.
* **Span Length:** Opens to about 7.5 inches, providing adequate range for gripping tasks.
* **Gear Ratio:** Recommended gear ratio of approximately 3:1 for increased torque, enhancing the grip strength of the jaws.

## Build Instructions

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Gear Assembly:**

    * Arrange four cogwheels in a straight line.
    * Mount the servo motor to drive one of the two central gears. This symmetrical placement ensures even distribution of torque to both jaws.

2. **Jaw Construction:**

    * Construct opposing jaws from sturdy LEGO Technic beams.
    * Connect jaws to the end gears, ensuring alignment and symmetrical operation.

3. **Grip Enhancement:**

    * Attach silicone pads or rubber grips to the inner surface of the jaws. This addition significantly improves friction and grip reliability.

### Tuning

* **Servo Strength:** Optimal servo power for a tight, secure grip is typically around 75-80%. Adjust servo strength depending on specific tasks and the weight of the objects being handled.
* **Test and Adjust:** Regularly test the grip using your competition objects and fine-tune servo positions and pad placements accordingly.

## Practical Tips

* **Maintenance:** Regularly check gear alignments and servo health to maintain efficiency.
* **Customization:** Easily adaptableâ€”modify jaw shapes or gear ratios to accommodate different object sizes and shapes.
