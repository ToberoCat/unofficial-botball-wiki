## Core Idea

The shifting parallelogram lift employs two parallel beams of equal length connected at pivot points to form a four-bar
linkage. As the beams rotate, the platform at the end remains consistently parallel to its base, enabling stable
vertical movement.

## Advantages

* **Stable Orientation:** Maintains the orientation of the payload consistently throughout its entire range of motion,
  ideal for tasks requiring precise object placement.
* **Enhanced Strength:** The dual-beam construction provides increased rigidity and load-bearing capability compared to
  simpler, single-beam designs.
* **Versatile Vertical Lift:** Especially effective in lifting and positioning objects such as noodles, cubes, or other
  game elements in a vertically straight path.

## Disadvantages

* **Limited Sweep Angle:** Due to its structural geometry, it is restricted to a maximum rotation of approximately 180
  degrees before mechanical interference occurs.
* **Material Intensive:** Requires additional beams and connecting elements, increasing build complexity and resource
  usage.
* **Increased Friction:** Multiple pivot points introduce additional friction, requiring careful attention to minimize
  resistance and maintain smooth operation.

## Optimal Usage Scenarios

* Tasks demanding consistent vertical orientation, such as stacking cubes, placing objects precisely, or engaging with
  elements that require fixed positional alignment.
* Situations where stability and accuracy outweigh the need for extensive horizontal reach.

## Quick Build Notes

* **Equal Beam Length:** Maintain identical lengths for parallel beams to ensure proper parallelogram function and
  uniform motion.
* **Structural Bracing:** Reinforce the rear bar adequately to prevent torsional flex or twisting, which can compromise
  stability and alignment.
* **Pivot Point Lubrication:** Regularly lubricate pivot points to minimize friction and ensure smooth, reliable
  movement.

## Enhancements and Variations

* **Counterweights:** Integrate counterweights to balance heavier payloads, reducing motor load and improving
  efficiency.
* **Motorized Joints:** Utilize servos or motors with encoders to precisely control motion and enhance positional
  accuracy and repeatability.
* **Extended Reach:** Explore alternate linkage geometries to slightly extend functional range without significantly
  compromising stability.

## Botball Applications

Successfully implemented during Botball's 2023 regional tournament for lifting and positioning pool noodles accurately
onto vertical poles. The stable orientation of this lift was crucial for tasks that required precise vertical alignment
and minimal object rotation.
