## Core Concept

The Vertical Claw "Excavator" is a specialized gripper designed for efficient top-down scooping and dragging of game elements. Utilizing a single servo motor and a claw-like mechanism, it excels at bulk collection tasks and acts similarly to a miniature bulldozer.

## Ideal Use Cases

* **Bulk Gathering:** Perfect for quickly collecting groups of poms or cubes.
* **Efficiency:** Extremely effective for clearing large areas by dragging items along with backward robot motion.
* **Simplicity and Reliability:** Fewer moving parts mean less maintenance and a lower risk of mechanical failure.

## Limitations

* **Precision Tasks:** Not suited for tasks requiring precise placement due to its inherently messy release mechanism.
* **Fine Manipulation:** Difficulty in handling singular or delicate objects accurately.

## Technical Specifications

* **Dimensions:** Approximately 4.8 inches by 5 inches.
* **Span Length:** Jaw opening spans approximately 3.1 inches, ideal for grabbing multiple objects simultaneously.
* **Optimal Operation:** Best used by lowering onto objects and dragging them, maximizing effectiveness by leveraging robot motion.

## Build Instructions

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Assembly of Claw Mechanism:**

    * Construct the vertical claw structure from sturdy LEGO Technic beams, ensuring a claw-like shape suitable for scooping.
    * Mount a servo motor securely at the bottom cogwheel to control opening and closing.

2. **Tooth Design:**

    * Taper the tooth profile on the claw jaws to optimize scooping and reduce resistance during dragging.
    * Ensure the teeth can penetrate beneath piles of poms or cubes effectively.

3. **Servo Setup:**

    * Configure servo operation to stall-hold at approximately 80% duty cycle. This setting provides maximum grip strength during dragging operations.

### Tuning and Optimization

* **Grip Adjustment:**

    * Test grip strength and adjust servo duty cycle slightly up or down based on practical tests with your specific game elements.

* **Drag Operation:**

    * Experiment with driving speeds and claw engagement angles to optimize the effectiveness of your scooping actions.

## Practical Tips

* **Maintenance:** Periodically inspect claw alignment and servo functionality, especially after aggressive use.
* **Customization:** Easily modify the claw profile or size to accommodate specific game elements and tasks more effectively.
